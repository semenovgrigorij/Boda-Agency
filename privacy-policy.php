          <p>
            4.3. We will not disclose your personal information to third

          <h4>Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            8.1. Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an
            identifier (a string of letters and numbers) sent by a web server
            to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is
            then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page
            from the server. Cookies may be either "persistent" or "session"
            cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a browser and will
            remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user
            before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will
            expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is
            closed. Cookies typically do not contain any information that
            personally identifies a user, but personal information that we
            store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
            obtained from cookies.
          </p>

            as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
            disputes, enforce our agreements, and in other cases permitted by
            law.
